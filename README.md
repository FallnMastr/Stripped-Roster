# Stripped-Roster
The Excel-based roster created for internal FedEx use, stripped of all employee information.

I was not paid to make this file, it was created in my spare time while at work and is only used by the single operating building I was employed at.  All names have been removed from the file, and a majority of the functionality does not work without internal FedEx timecard-generated reports.  This is not a document that is used company-wide and was neither commissioned by FedEx nor was I paid specifically to commit time to develop it.

The purpose of this posting is to provide the code as an example of my abilities to work with VBA code, which I taught myself for writing the code in this file, and is not being used outside of that purpose.
